			<h3>1. Welcome to Masters of Visuals</h3>
			<p>1.1 Introduction: Yanka Industries, Inc. d/b/a MasterClass (“MasterClass,” “we,” “us,” “our”) provides its services (described below) to you through its website located at  masterclass.com (the “Site”) and through its mobile applications and related services (collectively, such services, including any new features and applications, and the Site, the “Service(s)”), subject to the following Terms of Service (the “Terms of Service”). PLEASE READ THESE TERMS OF SERVICE CAREFULLY, AS THEY GOVERN YOUR USE OF THE SITE AND SERVICES, PARTICULARLY SECTION 10 (BINDING ARBITRATION; CLASS ACTION WAIVER), WHICH AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS IN THE EVENT OF A DISPUTE BETWEEN US.</p>

			<p><strong>1.2 Modifications to Terms of Service:</strong> We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to change or modify portions of these Terms of Service at any time. If we do this, depending on the nature of the change, we will post the changes on this page and indicate at the top of this page the date these terms were last revised and/or notify you, either through the Services' user interface, in an email notification or through other reasonable means and as required by applicable law. Any such changes will become effective no earlier than fourteen (14) days after they are posted, except that changes addressing new functions of the Services or changes made for legal reasons will be effective immediately. Your continued use of the Service after the date any such changes become effective constitutes your acceptance of the new Terms of Service. In addition, when using certain Services, you will be subject to any additional terms applicable to such Services that may be posted on the Service from time to time.</p>

			<p><strong>1.3 Privacy:</strong> At MasterClass, we respect the privacy of our users. For details please see our Privacy Policy. By using the Service, you consent to our collection and use of personal data as outlined therein.</p>

			<h3>2. Access and Use of the Service</h3>

			<p><strong>2.1 Use Description:</strong> The MasterClass service, and any content viewed through our service, is solely for your personal and non-commercial use. With your MasterClass purchase we grant you a limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, license to access the MasterClass content and view your course(s) through the service on a streaming-only basis for that purpose. Except for the foregoing limited license, no right, title or interest shall be transferred to you. You agree not to use the service for public performances. MasterClass may revoke your license at any time in its sole discretion. Upon such revocation, you must promptly destroy all content downloaded or otherwise obtained through the service, as well as copies of such materials, whether made in accordance with these Terms of Service or otherwise.</p>

			<p><strong>2.2 Your Registration Obligations:</strong> You may be required to register with MasterClass in order to access and use certain features of the Service. If you choose to register for the Service, you agree to provide and maintain true, accurate, current and complete information about yourself as prompted by the Service’s registration form. Registration data and certain other information about you are governed by our Privacy Policy. If you are under 13 years of age, you are not authorized to use the Service, with or without registering. In addition, if you are under 18 years old, you may use the Service, with or without registering, only with the approval of your parent or guardian.</p>

			<p><strong>2.3 Member Account, Password and Security:</strong> You may never use another's account, and you may not provide another person with the username and password to access your account. You are fully responsible for any and all activities that occur under your password or account, and it is your responsibility to ensure that your password remains confidential and secure. You agree to (a) immediately notify MasterClass of any unauthorized use of your password or account or any other breach of security, and (b) ensure that you exit from your account at the end of each session when accessing the Service. MasterClass will not be liable for any loss or damage arising from your failure to comply with this Section.</p>

			<p><strong>2.4 Modifications to Service:</strong> MasterClass reserves the right to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or any part thereof) with or without notice. You agree that MasterClass will not be liable to you or to any third party for any modification, suspension or discontinuance of the Service. We have no obligation to retain any of Your Account or Submitted Content for any period of time beyond what may be required by applicable law.</p>

			<p><strong>2.5 General Practices</strong> Regarding Use and Storage: You acknowledge that MasterClass may establish general practices and limits concerning use of the Service, including without limitation the maximum period of time that data or other content will be retained by the Service and the maximum storage space that will be allotted on MasterClass’s servers on your behalf. You agree that MasterClass has no responsibility or liability for the deletion or failure to store any data or other content maintained or uploaded by the Service. You acknowledge that MasterClass reserves the right to terminate accounts that are inactive for an extended period of time. You further acknowledge that MasterClass reserves the right to change these general practices and limits at any time, in its sole discretion, with or without notice.</p>

			<p><strong>2.6 Mobile Services:</strong> The Service may include certain services that are available via a mobile device, including (i) the ability to upload content to the Service via a mobile device, (ii) the ability to browse the Service and the Site from a mobile device and (iii) the ability to access certain features through an application downloaded and installed on a mobile device (collectively, the “Mobile Services”). To the extent you access the Service through a mobile device, your wireless service carrier’s standard charges, data rates and other fees may apply. In addition, downloading, installing, or using certain Mobile Services may be prohibited or restricted by your carrier, and not all Mobile Services may work with all carriers or devices. In using the Mobile Services, you may provide your telephone number. By providing your telephone number, you consent to receive calls and/or SMS, MMS, or text messages at that number. We may share your phone numbers with our affiliates or with our service providers (such as customer support, billing or collections companies, and text message service providers) who we have contracted with to assist us in pursuing our rights or providing our Services under these Terms of Service, our policies, applicable law, or any other agreement we may have with you. You agree these parties may also contact you using autodialed or prerecorded calls and text messages, as authorized by us to carry out the purposes we have identified above, and not for their own purposes. In the event you change or deactivate your mobile telephone number, you agree to promptly update your MasterClass account information to ensure that your messages are not sent to the person that acquires your old number.</p>

			<p><strong>2.7 Money Back Guarantee:</strong> Unless otherwise noted during your purchase of the Service you choose, as required by applicable law in your jurisdiction, or as set forth in the refund policy applicable to any Service you purchase through a third-party marketplace (see Section 3.3 below), should you become dissatisfied with the Service within the first 30 days after purchase, MasterClass will refund the full amount of your purchase and subsequently terminate your access. Refunds are not available for customers 30 days after a purchase. Refunds are not available for accounts which have violated the terms of service; violations are determined at MasterClass's sole discretion. If MasterClass determines that you are abusing our refund policy, we reserve the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse or restrict any and all current or future use of the Service without delivering a refund.
